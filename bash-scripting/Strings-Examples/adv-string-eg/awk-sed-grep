1. sed (Stream Editor):
Primarily used for text manipulation and transformation.
Works on a line-by-line basis, applying commands to each line.
Utilizes regular expressions for pattern matching and substitution.
Commonly used for in-place text substitution, deleting lines, and simple text editing tasks.
Limited ability to process structured data like columns.
Well-suited for batch processing and scripting.

2. awk:
Designed for more complex text processing and data extraction tasks.
Works on fields within lines, making it well-suited for structured data.
Provides powerful text manipulation capabilities, including conditional statements and loops.
Supports user-defined functions and variables.
Commonly used for data extraction, reporting, and processing tabular data.
Offers better support for handling structured data compared to sed.

3. grep (Global Regular Expression Print):
Primarily used for searching and filtering lines of text based on patterns.
Supports regular expressions for flexible pattern matching.
Useful for extracting specific lines from files, checking for the presence of a pattern, and filtering results.
Typically used in conjunction with other commands for text processing tasks.
Simpler and more specialized compared to sed and awk.
Excellent for tasks that involve finding and displaying lines that match a specific pattern.

4. sed vs. awk:
sed is more focused on text substitution and basic editing, whereas awk is better suited for more complex data processing tasks.
sed processes text line by line, whereas awk works on fields within lines, allowing for structured data manipulation.
sed doesn't have built-in variables or loops, while awk provides extensive scripting capabilities.
sed is often used for in-place editing, while awk is used for extracting and processing data.
sed is generally simpler and more lightweight compared to awk.

5. grep vs. awk:
grep is primarily used for searching and filtering lines based on patterns, while awk can perform more advanced text manipulation.
grep outputs matching lines, while awk can extract and process specific fields or perform calculations on data.
grep is ideal for quickly finding patterns in files, while awk is better suited for structured data processing.
grep is simpler and focused on pattern matching, whereas awk is a more versatile text processing tool.
grep is typically used as a filtering tool, while awk is used for more complex data extraction and manipulation tasks.
