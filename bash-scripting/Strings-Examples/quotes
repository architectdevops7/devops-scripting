Strings:
Single quotes
Double quotes
Escape Sequence

Single quotes
ex: 
    echo 'This is a $variable'  # Output: This is a $variable
Explanation: Single-quoted strings preserve the literal text, 
             so $variable is not treated as a variable but as part of the string.
ex: 
    echo 'This is a single quote '\'' inside single quotes'  # Output: This is a single quote ' inside single quotes

Double quotes
ex:
    variable="World"
    echo "Hello, $variable"  # Output: Hello, World

Escape Sequence
ex: 
    echo "This is a newline.\nThis is on a new line."
Explanation: Double-quoted strings interpret escape sequences like \n, 
             creating a newline.
